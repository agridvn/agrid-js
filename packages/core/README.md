# @agrid/core

Shared core functionality used across Agrid SDKs.

## What It Is

- Internal utilities, process helpers, types, and building blocks for `agrid-js`, `agrid-node`, `agrid-react`, `@agrid/nuxt`, and `@agrid/nextjs-config`.
- Not typically consumed directly by application code.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @agrid/core
# or
yarn add @agrid/core
# or
pnpm add @agrid/core
```

## When To Use

- Advanced integrations requiring low-level APIs exposed by the Agrid SDKs.
- Tooling that needs `@agrid/core/process` utilities (e.g., resolving CLI binaries).
